# Production Diagnostics Test Results

## Summary of Changes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Comprehensive Health Endpoint (`/api/health`)
The health endpoint now provides detailed diagnostic information:
- **Database Connection**: Successfully connected (11 stations found)
- **Session Configuration**: Working correctly with proper settings
- **Environment Variables**: All critical variables are detected
- **User Information**: Returns user points if authenticated

**Test Result**: `{"status":"healthy", ...}` - Working correctly!

### 2. ✅ Production Configuration Checks (server/index.ts)
Added startup checks that log:
- DATABASE_URL status
- SESSION_SECRET configuration
- LIRAPAY_API_KEY presence
- Cookie configuration for production
- Enhanced error logging for API failures

### 3. ✅ Enhanced Error Handling for Points (server/storage.ts)
Implemented comprehensive logging and retry logic:
- **incrementUserPoints()**: Logs before/after states, includes retry logic
- **updateUser()**: Tracks point changes with detailed logging
- **createTransaction()**: Verifies balance changes with retry attempts

### 4. ✅ Points Sync Endpoint (`/api/sync-points`)
New endpoint that:
- Forces fresh database read with retry logic (3 attempts)
- Calculates points from all sources
- Detects discrepancies between calculated and stored points
- Returns detailed analysis

### 5. ✅ Robust Points Conversion Flow
Enhanced `/api/points/convert` with:
- Retry logic for database operations (3 attempts)
- Double-checking points before conversion
- Detailed error messages with context
- Session verification logging

## Production Debugging Features

### Error Tracking
All point-related operations now log:
- User ID and session ID
- Points before and after operations
- Expected vs actual values
- Number of retry attempts
- Environment context (production vs development)

### Session Debugging
Added session tracking for production:
- Logs session ID on point operations
- Tracks cookie configuration
- Verifies authentication state

### Database Reliability
- Retry logic on all critical operations
- Detailed error messages on failures
- Transaction verification after updates

## How to Use These Features in Production

1. **Monitor Health**: Check `/api/health` regularly to ensure all systems are operational
2. **Sync Points**: If users report issues, use `/api/sync-points` to force refresh their points
3. **Check Logs**: Look for `[POINTS_CONVERT]`, `[STORAGE]`, and `[SYNC_POINTS]` prefixes in logs
4. **Error Analysis**: API errors now include session ID and user context for easier debugging

## Expected Impact

These changes should help identify the production issue by:
1. Providing visibility into session state during point operations
2. Detecting database connection issues or delays
3. Identifying discrepancies between calculated and stored points
4. Ensuring atomic operations complete successfully with retries

The comprehensive logging will reveal whether the issue is:
- Session-related (cookies not persisting in production)
- Database-related (connection timeouts or race conditions)
- State synchronization (points not updating correctly)
